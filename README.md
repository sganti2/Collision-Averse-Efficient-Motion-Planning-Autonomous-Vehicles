# Social Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles

## I. 2D_Motion_Planner
The "2D_Motion_Planner" directory consists of results for a Single-Agent interaction within the roundabout scenario. These results are categorized by the following vehicle models: holonomic model, quadrotor model, and bicycle model. In order to visualize the single-agent results, download OMG-tools here: https://github.com/meco-group/omg-tools. Once OMG-tools has been downloaded, copy the specific motion planning Python file from this repository into the OMG-tools repository. Be sure to copy the file into the "examples" directory. Execute the copied file as you would an example within the OMG-tools repository.
